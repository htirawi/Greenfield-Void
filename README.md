# :bowtie: Chat Buddy :bowtie:

[chat buddy](https://rbkchat.herokuapp.com/) it is a MEAN stack application to make chatting life easier.
We used socket.io to handel real time messages, and also we use WebRTC to make video call.
In this app you can make video calls ans chat messages between your friends.
You can also join chat rooms if you want private conservation.
In video call you can share the link of the video chat page, so each one has the link can join the conversation.
